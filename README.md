I see the issue. Let me check the GitHub repository you mentioned.

It appears that the frontend directory hasn't been uploaded to your GitHub repository. This could happen if:

1. The frontend directory was added to .gitignore
2. The frontend files weren't committed before pushing
3. There might be an issue with the repository setup

Let me help you fix this by creating a proper README.md file that reflects the current state of the repository and provides instructions for setting up the frontend.

```markdown:d:\Src\Small Project\CitizenReport\README.md
# Citizen Report

A web application with Express.js backend and React frontend for citizen reporting.

## Current Repository Status

Currently, this repository contains only the backend Express.js setup. The frontend React application needs to be set up separately by following the instructions below.

## Project Structure

```
CitizenReport/
├── backend/         # Express.js server
│   ├── server.js    # Main server file
│   ├── .env         # Environment variables
│   └── .env.example # Example environment file
└── package.json     # Root package.json for running both services
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm (v6 or newer)
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fathurp01/CitizenReport.git
cd CitizenReport
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Set up the frontend

Create and set up the React frontend:

```bash
# Create frontend directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir frontend
cd frontend

# Initialize a new React application
npx create-react-app .

# Install axios for API requests
npm install axios

# Update package.json to add proxy
```

After creating the React app, manually add the proxy configuration to the frontend's package.json:

```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5001"
```

Create a simple App.js to test the connection:

```bash
cd src
```

Replace the contents of App.js with:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('/api');
        setMessage(response.data.message);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        setMessage('Error connecting to the server');
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>Citizen Report</h1>
        {loading ? (
          <p>Loading...</p>
        ) : (
          <p>Message from server: {message}</p>
        )}
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 4. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory based on the example:

```bash
cd backend
copy .env.example .env
cd ..
```

Modify the `.env` file if needed. The default configuration uses port 5001.

### 5. Running the Application

To run both backend and frontend concurrently, update the root package.json scripts if needed, then:

```bash
npm start
```

To run them separately:

```bash
# Backend only
npm run server

# Frontend only
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Access the Application

- Backend API: http://localhost:5001/api
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api` - Welcome message (returns: `{ message: 'Welcome to CitizenReport API' }`)

## Troubleshooting

- If port 5001 is already in use, you can change it in the backend `.env` file
- Make sure the proxy in `frontend/package.json` matches the backend port
- If you encounter CORS issues, check that the backend CORS configuration is correct
